# Module 4 Challenge - School District Analysis

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this Analysis was to provide our client with a program to analyse the math and reading scores for the schools in her school district. Our client, Maria, has notified us the student data provided has errors due to academic dishonesty. To address this issue, our code is able to replace the affected student's math and reading scores and updates the school district 

## Results
There is a bulleted list that addresses how each of the seven school district metrics was affected by the changes in the data (10 pt).
Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

### Deliverable 1 - Replace Ninth-Grade Reading and Math Scores
The table below shows the modified student_data_df with the updated math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders. Our program replaces these students' scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact.

### Deliverable 2 - Repeat the School District Analysis
* There was a slight dcrease in the scores for average math schore, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading, and %overall passing.

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced (5 pt). Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

### Deliverable 3 - Written Report for the School District Analysis
